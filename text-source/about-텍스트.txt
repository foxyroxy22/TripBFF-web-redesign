Meet the Founders

Isabella Comellini
Co-Founder & CEO
"I kept hearing the same thing 
from my audience: 'I want to travel, 
but I have no one to go with.' 
That’s when I realized — we 
needed a better way to connect 
solo travelers. That’s how TripBFF 
began."

Ethan Brimhall
Co-Founder & CTO
"When Isabella shared her idea, I 
knew it could work — because 
tech should bring people together. 
We built TripBFF to help travelers 
feel confident and connected, no 
matter where they go."
